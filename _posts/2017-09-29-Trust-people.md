I was working for a big organization as a research intern for 5 months. 
It was the first time I was introduced to highly complex systems of trust and distrust. 
This was the first time I was faced with the fundamental question of "is it rational to trust a person ?".

In my short experience trusting employees brings up the same paradoxical problems as trusting ones relatives or friends. 
Trusting a person is an internal decision of the trusting agent and as a consequence it requires an internal evaluation 
of the trustee. The obvious problem is the feedback-loop that biases judgment: the more often I trusted a person 
the more trustworthy he becomes to me and the harder it gets for me to change my mind. 
Another problem is that there are so many unknown factors about the trustworthiness of individuals that it
becomes intractable to decide when considering too many people.

The solution of the organization I worked at was to assume that it is hard to trust so it is better to assume that 
distrust is more rational. Then a system of distrust is created through the introduction hierarchy and protocol.
A level-0 distrust in my world is when there are researchers headed by one leader. 
The researchers are responsible for research and the leader is responsible for getting resources. 
Level-1 distrust would be to artificially cluster researchers into N groups, headed by N group-leaders, 
who are headed by the research leader. This is what I would call "distrust by hierarchy" as there 
is an added level of control or distrust. Distrust by protocol is orthogonal to distrust by hierarchy. 
The group leaders can organize daily meetings and take notes of progress. These notes are then evaluated by 
the group leader. What I outlined here is a very high-level description of general system of distrust in companies
Next I would like to outline an argument in favour of the rationality of trust.

Let us start with the observation that trust is not necessarily truth-directed i.e.: I do not have to only 
trust trustworthy people. It can be goal-driven; I need to trust my co-workers simply, because I cannot get the 
job done alone. If we only have projects too big for a person this generates goal-driven trust by necessity. 
An interesting observation of Victoria McGeer is that being trusted often increases the likelihood of being trustworthy.
When trusting a person I have some beliefs about this persons trustworthiness and I update these beliefs based on 
evidence. The cool thing about McGeer's suggestion is that I also update the real-life trustworthiness of the person.
My personal life experience tells me that McGeer's observation is unfortuantely symmetric: 
distrusting people decreases their levels of trustworthiness. I find this a great argument in favor of trusting our fellow humans. 
Hope you do too.
