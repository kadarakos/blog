I was working for a huge organization as a research intern for 5 months. 
It was the first time I was introduced to highly complex systems of trust and distrust and
I was faced with the question everyday: "is it rational to trust a person?".

In my short experience trusting ones employees brings up the same paradoxical problems as trusting ones relatives or friends. 
Trusting a person is an internal decision of the trusting agent and as a consequence it requires an internal evaluation 
of the trustee. One obvious problem is the feedback-loop that biases judgment: the more often I trusted a person 
the more trustworthy he becomes to me and the harder it gets for me to change my mind. 
Another problem is that there are so many unknown factors about the trustworthiness of individuals that it
becomes intractable to decide when considering too many people - or probably any person for that matter.

The solution of the organization I worked at was to assume that it is difficult to establish trust so it is better to 
assume that distrust is more rational. Then a system of distrust is created through the introduction hierarchy and 
protocol. A level-0 distrust in my world is when there are creative people headed by one leader. 
The creative people are responsible for creating things and the leader is responsible for getting resources. 
Level-1 distrust would be to artificially cluster creatives into N groups, headed by N group-leaders, 
who are headed by the top leader. This is what I would call "distrust by hierarchy" as there 
is an added level of control or distrust. Distrust by protocol is orthogonal to distrust by hierarchy. 
The group leaders can organize daily meetings and take notes of progress. These notes are then evaluated by 
the group leader. What I outlined here is a very high-level description of general system of distrust in companies
Next I would like to outline an argument in favour of the rationality of trust.

Let us start with the observation that trust is not necessarily truth-driven i.e.: I do not have to only 
trust trustworthy people. It can be goal-driven; I need to trust my team members simply, because I cannot get the 
job done alone. If we only have projects too big for one person this generates goal-driven trust by necessity. 
Now, an important wisdom of parenting to consider is that being trusted often increases the likelihood of being trustworthy.
When trusting a person I have some beliefs about this persons trustworthiness and I update these beliefs based on 
evidence. The amazing thing is that I also update the real-life trustworthiness of the person.
My personal life experience tells me that this observation is unfortuantely symmetric: 
distrusting people decreases their levels of trustworthiness. I find this a great argument in favor of trusting our fellow humans. 
Hope you do too.
