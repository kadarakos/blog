I find it very hard to stay on track with a reasonable routine. Eversince I've started my Bachelor's my 
daily routine has been chaotic. Recently I moved to Toronto in August. First into an airbnb 
for way too long. Then I've finally found a place and managed to move to a condo end of October.  

Since then I had to fly back to the Netherlands to defend my PhD middle of November. So that is done with.
This was followed up by spending Christmas in Finland 
with my partner and her family end of December to beginning of January.   

One of my main plans with moving to Toronto was to finally have a
normal schedule after the nightmareish PhD lifestyle. I've failed so far. But now I've just turned 30 December 30, 
2019 and so I feel like its a good opportunity to treat myself to another chance. 
Don't get me wrong, I think my lifestyle is
okay, but I feel like I could have a nicer experience in life. 
In order to achieve just that I came up with a somewhat 
arbitrary and simple enough plan for my days, that hopefully even I can follow. 
The main goals of this experiment are:

- Feel more control over my life.
- Be generally more relaxed.
- Have more time for my passion projects.
- Enable myself to plan for vacations and such better.

## Morning

My morning routine so far comprised of waking up too late, listening to music anyway and going to work.
This time around I'll attempt to implement an actual routine. **Monday**, **Wedneday** and **Friday** are the
morning workout days:

- 7:00 wake up.
- Wash my face.
- Put on some [gentle music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zreVOAijs2Y).
- Drink water or preferably tea.
- 7:15 go to the gym.
- Warm up until kinda 7:30.
- Rowing machine, pushup, pullup, lunges, and some core shit until 8:00
- Shower until 8:15.
- Eat simple ass breakfast (cook eggs or just sandwich) until 8:30.
- Get ready and leave by 8:45

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday** I just wake up at 8:00 and eat some stuff, enjoy my life and talk
to bunbunz until 8:45 (maybe talk to her on the way, yaaay).

1. Arrive at 9-9:30.
2. Get my tea.

4. Do work until 12:00.
5. Go for lunch and finish until 12:30-1pm.

1. Buy some food and eat it until 7:30
2. Go to the gym at 8:30.
