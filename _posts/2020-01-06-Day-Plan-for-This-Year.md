I find it very hard to stay on track for some reasonable way of living. Moved to Toronto in August, first into an airbnb 
for way too long. Finally found a place and managed to move into a condo end of October. Since then I had to fly back
to the Netherlands to defend my PhD middle of November. This was followed up by spending Christmas in Finland 
with my partner end of December to beginning of January. One of my main plans with moving to Toronto was to finally have a
normal schedule after the nightmareish PhD lifestyle, but I've failed so far. I've just turned 30 December 30, 2019 and so
I feel like its a good opportunity to treat myself to another chance in 2020. Don't get me wrong, I think my lifestyle is
okay, but I feel like I could have a nicer experience in life. In order to achieve just that I came up with a somewhat 
arbitrary and simple enough plan for my days, that hopefully even I can follow. I decided to go for simple and gentle 
morning workouts so that I need not to be super motivated in my depressed times. 

## Morning routine

My morning routine so far comprised of waking up too late, listening to music anyway and going to work.
This time around I'll attempt to implement an actual routine:

1. 6:00 wake up (already scared).
2. Wash my face.
3. Put on some [gentle music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zreVOAijs2Y).
4. Drink water.
5. Put on some fucking asian packet soup.
6. 6:30ish start eating.
7. 7:15 go to the gym.
8. 8:15 leave the gym.
9.
