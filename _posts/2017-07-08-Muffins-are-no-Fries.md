At Tim Horton's
-------------------------------

Person: What can I get you?  
Me: Can I have a Ranch, Bacon Chicken Wrap with Fries?  
Person: Sure, would you like anything to drink?  
Me: A latte.  
Person: Cold or warm?  
Me: Hot.  

Time passes by ...  

Person: Sorry we are out of Fries.  
Me: Its okay.     
Person: Would you like a doughnut or muffin instead?   
Me: Muffin?   
Person: Soup maybe?  
Me: No just the the Wrap and the Latte.  

Time passes by ... 

Person: Unfortunately we have no more Latte, can I offer you a Landmower instead?  
Me: Landmower?  
Person: If you buy 3 Landmowers this week you get a 5 minute lap dance for free.  
Me: Can I just get the Wrap?  
Person: No problem, coming right up!  

Time passes by ...  

Person: Here is your Jalapeno Asiago Mozzarella Specialty Bagel.  
Me: That sounds very unappetizing.   
Person: Can I get you a Ranch, Bacon Chicken Wrap menu instead?  
Person: It comes with Fries and a drink of your choice!  
Me: Can you give me a time machine instead?
